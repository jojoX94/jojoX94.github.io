# Updating the Website

Hey there! If you're a senior developer looking to update the website, you're in the right place. Follow these simple steps to get things done smoothly. üòÄ

## Steps to Update the Website

### Step 1: Build the React Application

First, make sure you have the latest version of the codebase. Then, navigate to the root directory of the React application.

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile the React application and create a production-ready build in the `build` directory.

### Step 2: Copy the Build Contents

Once the build process is complete, navigate to the `build` directory within your React application. Copy all the contents of this directory.

### Step 3: Paste into the Local Repository

Now, navigate to your local repository where the website is hosted. Paste the contents you copied from the `build` directory into your local repository.

### Step 4: Commit and Push Changes

Commit the changes you made to your local repository with an appropriate commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update website with latest build"
git push origin main
```

This will push the changes to the main branch of your remote repository, thereby updating the website.
